 Quoting System: 
   ☐ Add appropriate zip codes to the BNAMILEP File
       NOTE: This will add the ability for the quoting system to match practical miles even when only zip to zip is provided.

   ☐ Intigrate with Rand McNally
       NOTE: necessary hooks

   ☐ Build in detection for empty values on money, they are breaking JavaScript on the client side.

   ✔ Rework the view results to place them in an array of object @done (16-07-11 16:35)
       NOTE: Will need to look into how to sort an array of objects based on a single attribute of the objects. Maybe do an array of arrays.
